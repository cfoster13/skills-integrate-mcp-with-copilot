# Add filter, sort, and search controls for activities list

This PR implements the following enhancements for issue #4:

- Adds a search box, filter dropdown (by schedule), and sort dropdown to the activities section.
- Updates the JavaScript to filter, sort, and search activities live as the user interacts with the controls.
- Styles the new UI elements for a clean and modern look.

**How it works:**
- Users can search activities by name or description.
- Filter activities by schedule.
- Sort activities by name or by available spots.

These changes improve navigation and usability for students and staff.
